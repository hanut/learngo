# Basic CRUD and Admin Panel using the Fiber framework

This example is a simple application that exposes a JWT protected
api for managing users as well as a session based admin portal
for displaying a web GUI that consumes the api.

**NOTE - This example shows both session and JWT authentication together as an example. This may not be useful or may be completely unfit for your use case/application in production. Please study your requirements carefully before picking an authentication mechanism.**
